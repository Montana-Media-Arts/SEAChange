This supplemental website accompanies the in-person summer cap offered by S.E.A. Change in partnership with [The School of Media Arts, University of Montana](http://www.umt.edu/mediaarts/).

The [**syllabus**]({{ site.baseurl }}/syllabus/ ) contains more information about the course, as well as student expectations.

### Start the Camp!

Each week's content can be chosen from the "Modules" tab up above in the navigation bar (or in the "hamburger" menu if you are on a mobile device).

There you should find a link to '[Day 1]({{site.baseurl}}/modules/day-1/welcome-to-mart120/)'. As weeks become active, you will find them populate that drop-down menu.
